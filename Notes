- The app only works connected to a GroundControlServer. No offline/cached data management.
- UI 100% Swift, some parts (such as frameworks) may be in ObjC
- Almost no storage on disk (except preferences and minor resources), no Core Data, everything in memory?
- minimum target: macOS 10.12 

- Do not depend on AlamoFire or another huge HTTP framework. Uses CFXNetworkOperation subclasses (objC)
- "GC" as prefix for the (as few as possible) objC classes?
- use bindings extensively since it seems quite dedicated to listing in tableviews and +/- buttons (typically with NSArrayController) ?
