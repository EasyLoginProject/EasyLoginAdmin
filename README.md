# EasyLoginAdmin

This app offer full admin capabilities on EasyLogin, regardless of instance location.

At this time, this application if "functionnality oriented" (i.e.: ugly), we will work on UI and UX as soon as we've all functionalities working.

In the end, this app will allow sys admin to manage:
* Identities, groups and role
* SyncSet (tell which account should be provisionned on which device or group of device)
* Munki catalogs
* Configuration profiles

We've the goal to port this tool as much as possible on iOS, code written for this project should be as portable as possible.
